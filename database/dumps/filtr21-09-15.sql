In¬†November&#13;\n2010, he ran a combination of two events, F.ounders (not to be&#13;\nconfused with Founders Forum) and the first Dublin <a href=\"http://www.websummit.net\">Web Summit</a>, which attracted&#13;\naround 400 people -- including Jack Dorsey and Chad Hurley,&#13;\ncofounders of Twitter and YouTube. In November 2014, according to&#13;\nCosgrave, more than 22,000 people attended Dublin\'s Web Summit, and&#13;\nsister events ran in New York, Hong Kong and Las Vegas.¬†</p><p>Cosgrave, 31, studied economics and politics at Trinity College,&#13;\nDublin, but \"was always building things online with friends, from&#13;\ninvites for parties to a really bad social network that nobody&#13;\nused,\" he says. Now his technology events host speakers from Peter&#13;\nThiel to Eva Longoria, and employ over 100 people. Cosgrave spoke&#13;\nto WIRED about how he grew his event into one of Europe\'s biggest&#13;\ntech conferences.¬†</p><p><strong>What inspired you to create the first Web&#13;\nSummit?</strong><br/>&#13;\n I organised a conference when I left college [Trinity College,&#13;\nDublin] and found out very quickly that the conference industry,&#13;\nalthough amazing in bringing inspiring entrepreneurs together, was&#13;\nvery unscientific and un-technological. I think you can make&#13;\nconferences better by using statistics and a little bit of code.&#13;\nThe first conference was in October 2009 in a small hotel in&#13;\nDublin. It wasn\'t properly organised and about 150 people turned&#13;\nup. I¬†thought nothing of it; I¬†had no interest in&#13;\nconferences whatsoever.¬†</p><p>But I thought it was good for Ireland -- you have all these&#13;\ngreat tech people who would fly to London or Paris or Berlin and I&#13;\nwas like, \"Why the hell does nobody come to Ireland?\" So I just&#13;\ninvited some people. It¬†wasn\'t until October 2010 that we&#13;\nturned it into something more meaningful. Four hundred people&#13;\nshowed up. We had Jack Dorsey, Niklas Zennstr√∂m and¬†Chad&#13;\nHurley.¬†¬†</p><p><strong>What do you think attracted people to what was then an&#13;\nunknown event?<br/></strong> <span>I just said, \"Come and speak and also spend some&#13;\ntime with each other.\" Most of them had never been on a pub-crawl&#13;\nbefore. In 2011, Bono agreed that he would host one of the pub&#13;\ncrawls, and that became an attraction in its own right. Every year&#13;\nhe takes 15 other founders, from Elon Musk to Drew Houston to Reed&#13;\nHastings, on a magical pub crawl of Dublin. Oddly, people in&#13;\nSilicon Valley who make the software that connects the world don\'t&#13;\nget a lot of time to meet each other. In Dublin there are no&#13;\ndistractions so you can hang out for two-and-a-half days.&#13;\n¬†</span></p><p><strong>What role does technology play in how you organise your&#13;\nevents?<br/></strong> <span>Our growth has been largely propelled by network&#13;\nscience. All we\'ve done over time is to expand on that approach of&#13;\nengineering serendipity at the scale of 20,000 attendees. There\'s a&#13;\nhuge amount of randomness at events so we try to take control of&#13;\nsome of that using algorithms for optimal outcomes. In 2010, I was&#13;\nputting together the table plans for the first event.&#13;\nIt¬†was¬†three days, with dinners, lunches, breakfasts and&#13;\npub-crawls, with about 200 people each. I asked event organisers&#13;\nhow to draw up a table plan. They said it\'s really hard, you have&#13;\nto be so careful and focus on the top table to begin with. I didn\'t&#13;\nwant a top table; I¬†wanted to evenly distribute everybody&#13;\nacross these 20 tables of ten. I sat down with a friend who is an&#13;\napplied statistician [Kevin Cunningham, now campaigns targeting and&#13;\nanalysis manager for Labour] and we just created a pretty basic&#13;\nbrute-force algorithm that just created the seating plans based on&#13;\na number of constraints.¬†</span></p><p><strong>How do you develop the data science behind the&#13;\nevent?<br/></strong> <span>We hire applied statisticians, engineers and&#13;\nphysicists with a background in complex systems and network&#13;\nanalysis. With the social web, you can increasingly see the&#13;\nconnections people have to other people, so we apply that insight&#13;\nto something as simple as our chat app and a networking app at the&#13;\nWeb Summit. If you\'re a developer, we see the types of people that&#13;\nyou want to connect with, so we have a recommendation system based&#13;\non what we know about you and the rest of the delegates. It turns&#13;\nout, for example, that we hadn\'t realised that many of the startups&#13;\nthat attended weren\'t looking for investors, but for talent --&#13;\nspecifically, they were looking for developers. We had never got to&#13;\nsee that at scale, because we were never able to see in real time&#13;\nwho was actually connecting with whom. So that allows you to think&#13;\nabout how you improve and build the system the next&#13;\nyear.¬†</span></p><p><strong>Does data contribute to your speaker selection?<br/></strong> <span>We use software called NetworkX to look at&#13;\nnetworks. So, for instance, if you want to figure out who is the&#13;\nsingle most important speaker for a given community, the algorithm&#13;\nhelps us discover who people look to the most. It turns out that&#13;\nGavin Andresen, the chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, is,&#13;\namong the hardcore bitcoin community, the person that people look&#13;\nto most. We use that approach to help us figure out who should come&#13;\nand speak on certain topics on certain stages. ¬†</span></p><p><strong>Regarding how delegates interact during a conference,&#13;\nwas there any insight from the data that surprised you?<br/></strong> <span>Conferences don\'t end at 5pm, according to our&#13;\n[networking] data. In¬†terms of people communicating with each&#13;\nother through the app, we found that there\'s a flurry in the&#13;\nmorning, probably related to planning meetings, and then from 7pm&#13;\nto 10pm there\'s a flurry of activity again. So that\'s when we put&#13;\non lots of small events to cater for different communities. It&#13;\ncould be as granular as a Python meetup, so if you want to recruit&#13;\na Python developer, you can go crash that party. ¬†</span></p><p><strong>What else have you learned?<br/></strong> <span>I see a lot of mistakes at our conference. For&#13;\ninstance, we looked at queuing. It turns out Disney has done lots&#13;\nof pretty compelling research on queuing and how to improve the&#13;\nqueuing experience. One of our scientists has a background in&#13;\nmachine vision so we have GoPros all over the venue and, just like&#13;\nWalmart tries to improve the flow of people through their stores,&#13;\nwe use the footage to try to improve the flow of people through an&#13;\nexhibition area. ¬†</span></p><p><strong>You are expanding to other global cities, with new&#13;\nconferences such as Collision, held in downtown Las Vegas last May.&#13;\nWhat is your strategy for expanding&#13;\ninto¬†unfamiliar¬†territories?<br/></strong> <span>Collision is growing at a faster rate than Web&#13;\nSummit ever grew. It\'ll probably go from 1,500 to 10,000 attendees&#13;\nin basically a single cycle, which is reasonably substantial&#13;\ngrowth. We\'re also expanding to Hong Kong and into verticals. We\'re&#13;\ngoing to do an event in the payment space and we\'re going to do one&#13;\nin the currency space and one in the enterprise space. So many of&#13;\nour hires out of the last six months have come from SF, London,&#13;\nBerlin, Milan, Moscow, Australia, Madrid, just other places around&#13;\nthe world. I think maybe another 100 people will join the company&#13;\nover the next 12 months and many of those will come from&#13;\nabroad.¬†</span></p>\n\n\n		                    \n\n		                    		   \n\n\n\n                            \n			                    \n                            \n                             \n		                        \n\n\n			                    \n	                    </div>','1','wired-co-uk-magazine-archive-2015-03-start-scaling-dublin-summit','wired.co.uk','441733cb47f9da37679819fb44d06115','0','2015-09-19 18:45:09','2015-09-19 18:45:09'),

The firm has invested in relatively few cleantech companies and avoided some of the overhyped sectors. Electric car startups, in particular, can require huge amounts of money to get off the ground, and can be very risky.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs unclear how much money Sequoia Capital has invested into the Chinese electric car maker. Sequoia, which opened a China office in 2005, currently has <a href=\"http://www.sequoiacap.cn/en/\">50 people there</a>.

The market for electric cars is still relatively small, but it has grown considerably since Tesla‚Äôs founding in 2003.</p>\n<p>That some of these electric car startups are in China is not particularly surprising. China‚Äôs government is looking to grow a domestic electric car industry, and is offering support for battery and auto companies that are willing to build factories in the country. China also has been discouraging gasoline powered cars in certain regions, as well as car ownership in general, to reduce its infamously bad air pollution.</p>\n<p>The Chinese government has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/31/us-autos-china-electric-idUSKCN0R01VL20150831\">reportedly decided recently</a> to <span id=\"articleText\">encourage non-automotive companies to invest in electric cars. That‚Äôs one reason why Internet companies and the entrepreneurs who build them may be interested in creating new electric car companies. Chinese Internet giant Alibaba and smartphone maker Xiaomi Technology have both considered investments in electric cars, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/31/us-autos-china-electric-idUSKCN0R01VL20150831\">according to Reuters</a>.<br/></span></p>\n<p>However, because China is willing to heavily subsidize domestic technologies and markets, Chinese tech companies can face a constant boom and bust cycle. China‚Äôs solar industry soared, and later hit a wall, because of too much government support.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Chinese electric car startups that gain fame could potentially crash and burn from this government-supported roller coaster ride.

	(4,'http://www.wired.com/2015/09/whatsapp-serves-900-million-users-50-engineers/','Why WhatsApp Only Needs 50 Engineers for Its 900M Users','<div id=\"start-of-content\"><p>Earlier this month, in a post to his Facebook page, WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum announced that his¬†company‚Äôs instant messaging service is now used by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/jan.koum/posts/10153580960970011?pnref=story\">more than 900 million people</a>. And then Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promptly responded with two posts of his own. One said ‚Äúcongrats,‚Äù and the other included a cheeky photo Zuckerberg had taken of Koum as the WhatsApp CEO keyed his 900-million-user post into a smartphone. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs an action shot of you writing this update,‚Äù Zuckerberg wrote.</p>\n<p>WhatsApp is¬†owned by Facebook, after Zuckerberg and company paid $19 billion for the startup a little more than a year ago. That means Facebook now runs three of the most popular apps on the internet. Its primary social networking service is used by more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, and Facebook Messenger, an instant messaging service spun off from Facebook proper, spans 700 million. But the 900 million-user milestone announced by Koun is very much a WhatsApp achievement, not a product of the formidable Facebook machine.</p>\n<p data-js=\"fader\" class=\"pullquote carve fader\">\n	WhatsApp shows the way forward to a world where internet services can serve a massive audience with help from few people.	<span class=\"attribution\"/>\n</p>\n\n<p>One of the (many) intriguing parts of the WhatsApp story is that it has achieved such enormous scale with such a tiny team. When the company was acquired by Facebook, it had 35 engineers and reached more than¬†450 million users. Today, it employs only about 50 engineers, though the number of WhatsApp users has doubled, and this tiny engineering staff continues to run things almost entirely on its own. In a world where so many internet services are rapidly expanding to millions upon millions of users, WhatsApp shows the way forward‚Äîat least in part.</p>\n<p>WhatsApp doesn‚Äôt talk much about its engineering work‚Äîor any other part of its operation, for that matter‚Äîbut yesterday, at an event in San Jose, California, WhatsApp software engineer Jamshid Mahdavi <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57Ch2j8U0lk\">took the stage</a> to briefly discuss the company‚Äôs rather unusual methods. Part of the trick is that the company builds its service using a programming language called Erlang. Though not all that popular across the wider coding community, Erlang is particularly well suited to juggling communications from a huge number of users, and it lets engineers deploy new code on the fly. But Mahdavi says that the trick is as much about attitude as technology.</p>\n<p>Mahdavi joined WhatsApp about two years ago, after the startup was up and running, and its approach to engineering was unlike any he had seen‚Äîin part because it used Erlang and a computer operating system called FreeBSD, but also because it strove to keep its operation so simple. ‚ÄúIt was a completely different way of building a high-scale infrastructure,‚Äù he said on Monday. ‚ÄúIt was an eye-opener to see the minimalistic approach to solving ‚Ä¶ just the problems that needed to be solved.‚Äù</p>\n<h3>Code in Parallel</h3>\n<p>In using Erlang, WhatsApp is part of a larger push towards programming languages that are designed for <em>concurrency</em>, where many processes run at the same time. As internet services reach more people‚Äîand juggle more tasks from all those people‚Äîsuch languages become more attractive. Naturally.</p>\n<p>With its new anti-spam system‚Äîa system for identifying malicious and otherwise unwanted messages on its social network‚ÄîFacebook <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/09/facebooks-new-anti-spam-system-hints-future-coding/\">uses a language called Haskell</a>. Haskell began as a kind of academic experiment in the late ‚Äô80s, and it‚Äôs still not used all that often. But it‚Äôs ideal for Facebook‚Äôs spam fighting because it‚Äôs so good at juggling parallel tasks‚Äîand because it lets coders tackle urgent tasks so quickly. Meanwhile, Google and Mozilla, maker of the Firefox browser, are striving for a similar sweet spot with new languages called Go and Rust.</p>\n<p data-js=\"fader\" class=\"pullquote carve fader\">\n	In essence, WhatsApp is a replacement for telecoms\' texting services.	<span class=\"attribution\"/>\n</p>\n\n<p>Like Haskell, Erlang is a product of the ‚Äô80s. Engineers at Ericsson, the Swedish multinational that builds hardware and software for telecom companies, developed the language for use with high-speed phone networks. ‚ÄúInstead of inventing a language and then figuring out what to do with it, they set out to invent a language which solved a very specific problem,‚Äù says Francesco Cesarini, an Erlang guru based in the UK. ‚ÄúThe problem was that of massive scalability and reliability. Phone networks were the only systems at the time who had to display those properties.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Erlang remains on the fringes of the modern coding world, but at WhatsApp and other internet companies, including WeChat and Whisper, it has found a home with new applications that operate not unlike a massive phone network. In essence, WhatsApp is a replacement for cellphone texting services. It too requires that ‚Äúscalability and reliability.‚Äù</p>\n<p>What‚Äôs more, Erlang lets coders work at high speed‚Äîanother essential part of modern software development. It offers a way of deploying new code to an application even as the application continues to run. In an age of constant change, this is more useful than ever. </p>\n<h3>Keep It Simple, Smarty</h3>\n<p>The language does have its drawbacks. Relatively few coders know Erlang, and it doesn‚Äôt necessarily dovetail with a lot of the code already built by today‚Äôs internet companies. Facebook built its original Facebook Chat app in Erlang but eventually rebuilt so that it would better fit with the rest of its infrastructure. ‚ÄúYou had this little island that was Erlang, and it was hard to build enough boats back to the island to make everything hook in,‚Äù says Facebook vice president of engineering Jay Parikh.</p>\n<p>Of course, WhatsApp didn‚Äôt have to integrate with an existing infrastructure in this way. And Mahdavi believes the relative scarcity of Erlang coders isn‚Äôt a problem. ‚ÄúOur strategy around recruiting is to find the best and brightest engineers. We don‚Äôt bring them in specifically because the engineer knows Erlang,‚Äù Mahdavi said on Monday. ‚ÄúWe expect the engineer to come in and spend their first week getting familiar with the language and learning to use the environment. If you hire smart people, they‚Äôll be able to do that.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The company has succeeded by hiring engineers who are adaptable‚Äîin more ways than one. Asked to explain the company‚Äôs secret, Mahdavi‚Äôs response seems far too simple. But that‚Äôs the point. ‚ÄúThe number-one lesson is just be very focused on what you need to do,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDoing spend time getting distracted by other activities, other technologies, even things in the office, like meetings.‚Äù</p>\n<p>At WhatsApp, employees almost never attend a meeting. Yes, there are only a few dozen of them. But that too is the point.</p>\n\n			<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link focusable bg-white\" href=\"#start-of-content\">Go Back to Top.

But consider the California Roll ‚Äî understanding the impact of this icon of Japanese dining can make all the difference between the success or failure of your product.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôve ever felt the frustration of customers not biting, then you can sympathize with Japanese restaurant owners in America during the 1970s. Sushi consumption was all but non-existent. By all accounts, Americans were scared of the stuff. Eating raw fish was an aberration and to most, tofu and seaweed were punch lines, not food.</p>\n<p>Then came the California Roll. While the origin of the famous maki is <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Who-invented-the-California-Roll\" target=\"_blank\">still contested</a>, its impact is undeniable. The California Roll was made in the USA by combining familiar ingredients in a new way. Rice, avocado, cucumber, sesame seeds, and crab meat ‚Äî the only ingredient unfamiliar to the average American palate was the barely visible sliver of nori seaweed holding it all together.</p>\n<h3>Familiar Done Differently</h3>\n<p>The California Roll provided a gateway to discover Japanese cuisine and demand exploded. Over the next few decades sushi restaurants, which were once confined to large coastal cities and almost exclusively served Japanese clientele, suddenly went mainstream. Today, sushi is served in small rural towns, airports, strip malls, and stocked in the deli section of local supermarkets. Americans now consume <a href=\"http://www.statisticbrain.com/sushi-industry-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">$2.25 billion</a> of sushi annually.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1521\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" readability=\"32\"><img class=\"wp-image-1521 size-medium\" src=\"http://nireyal.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-16-at-3.55.06-PM-300x200.png\" alt=\"California Roll\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The California Roll was sushi‚Äôs gateway into millions of American mouths.</p></div>\n<p>The lesson of the California Roll is simple ‚Äî <em>people don‚Äôt want something truly new, they want the familiar done differently</em>. Interestingly, this lesson applies just as much to the spread of innovation as it does to tastes in food.</p>\n<p>For example, the graphical user interface, a milestone in the popularization of the personal computer, used familiar visual metaphors like folders, notepads, windows, and trash cans to appeal to mainstream users terrified by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface\" target=\"_blank\">command-line interface</a> (perhaps even more than the thought of eating raw fish). The computer underneath was the same, however the familiar veneer suddenly made it accessible.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1519\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" readability=\"32\"><img class=\"wp-image-1519 size-medium\" src=\"http://nireyal.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Apple_Macintosh_Desktop-300x200.png\" alt=\"Apple\'s skeuomorphic design was the California Roll of the personal computer.  &quot;Apple Macintosh Desktop&quot; by unknown. (Image Credit: Wikipedia)\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Apple‚Äôs early skeuomorphic design was the California Roll of the personal computer.</p></div>\n<p>Quaint but unnecessary representations of the familiar became a hallmark of Apple products. As Claire Evans wrote for <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-eulogy-for-skeumorphism\" target=\"_blank\">Motherboard</a>, ‚ÄúWhile under the direction of the late Steve Jobs, Apple‚Äôs design aesthetic tended heavily towards the skeuomorphic. The Apple desktop calendar, famously, is rendered with accents of rich Corinthian leather; its bookshelves gleam with wood veneers, its chrome always brushed, its pages stitched and torn, its tabletop felt green.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Now that Apple serves a generation familiar with how its products work, it can shepherd them from California Rolls to sashimi, so to speak. ‚ÄúWe understood that people had already become comfortable with touching glass,‚Äù <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/09/19/apple-jony-ive-craig-federighi/2834575/\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> Apple‚Äôs Jony Ive. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt need physical buttons, they understood the benefits.‚Äù</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1518\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" readability=\"32\"><img class=\"wp-image-1518 size-medium\" src=\"http://nireyal.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_6747-e1434494486718-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Passbook Wallet\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mini credit cards are Apple‚Äôs California Roll for mobile payment.</p></div>\n<p>However, Apple still uses its tried and true methods whenever the company wants users to adopt a new behavior. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/2932541/apple-replaces-passbook-with-wallet-as-apple-pay-expands-to-u-k.html\" target=\"_blank\">rebranded Apple Wallet</a> helps users feel comfortable with the technology by making payment options look just like mini credit cards. Even though there‚Äôs no technical reason to do so, Apple understands the power of the familiar.</p>\n<h3>(Un)Familiarity Breeds Contempt</h3>\n<p>As I wrote about in my book, <a href=\"http://www.nirandfar.com/gethooked\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Hooked</em></a>, unfamiliar products and interfaces are more difficult to use and can impede adoption. Several <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion_(psychology)\" target=\"_blank\">psychological phenomena</a>¬†conspire to make us resist the atypical.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://bjfogg.com/fbm_files/page4_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">BJ Fogg</a> of Stanford‚Äôs Persuasive Technology Lab, ‚Äúnon-routine‚Äù is one of six ‚ÄúElements of Simplicity‚Äù ‚Äî the factors that affect the likelihood of any particular human action occurring. Fogg wrote, ‚ÄúWhen people face a behavior that is not routine, then they may not find it simple. In seeking simplicity, people will often stick to their routine, like buying gas at the same station, even if it costs more money or time than other options.‚Äù</p>\n<p>Of course, we also have a love for ‚Äúnew and improved‚Äù but in relatively modest proportions. ‚ÄúNew and improved‚Äù is great for things we are already familiar with ‚Äî like cereal and dish soap ‚Äî but not for products where we lack a frame of reference.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our aversion to things that are outside the norm is particularly hard on companies producing radical innovation ‚Äî no matter how beneficial they may be. If using a new product does not feel familiar, it faces severe challenges. According Fogg, ‚ÄúPeople are generally resistant to teaching and training because it requires effort. This clashes with the natural wiring of human adults: We are fundamentally lazy. As a result, products that require people to learn new things routinely fail.‚Äù</p>\n<h3>What‚Äôs Your California Roll?</h3>\n<p>When describing the Apple Watch, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come\" target=\"_blank\">Jony Ive said</a> his goal was to build ‚Äúthe strangely familiar.‚Äù The smart watch is exactly the kind of innovation that is still too new for all but the most early of early adopters. And yet Ive obsessed over the details of the Digital Crown, an esthetic adopted from traditional watchmaking. Clearly, Ive knows what he‚Äôs doing ‚Äî industry <a href=\"http://www.slashgear.com/analysts-apple-watch-could-top-19-million-in-2015-08372629/\" target=\"_blank\">analysts expect</a> the company to sell 19 million units this year.</p>\n<p>As the pace of innovation accelerates, human behavior, not technological restraints, will be the deciding factor of whether products are adopted or discarded. If new products and services are to positively impact our lives, they must find a gateway into our daily routines. The <em>familiar done differently</em> is the way to users‚Äô minds and hearts ‚Äî and sometimes their stomachs.</p>\n<h3>Here‚Äôs the gist:</h3>\n<ul><li>The California Roll introduced Americans to sushi by using familiar ingredients arranged in a new way.</li>\n<li>The California Roll Rule: <i>People don‚Äôt want something truly new, they want the familiar done differently.</i></li>\n<li>Things that are truly new need to use familiar mental models to gain user adoptions (i.e., Apple‚Äôs use of skeuomorphs.)</li>\n<li>Unfamiliar interfaces are more difficult to use and impede adoption.</li>\n<li>If your new product or service is not engaging users,¬†ask ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs my California Roll?‚Äù</li>\n</ul><h3>What do you think?</h3>\n<p>What was your familiar gateway into a new technology or product?

What an odd thing to give away like candy (it‚Äôs all free, the price tag is just an FYI).</p>\n<center><img src=\"/assets/xfbheadphones.jpg.pagespeed.ic.mgZb66pSHV.jpg\"/></center>\n<p>I‚Äôve read <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/05/28/startup-perks-culture/\" target=\"_blank\">the news</a>, as I‚Äôm sure you have, so I‚Äôm familiar with the amazing, sometimes outlandish perks large tech companies give to their employees.</p>\n<ul><li>Expensify takes employees on an annual month-long trip to an exotic destination</li>\n<li>Apple offers the opportunity for women to freeze their eggs</li>\n<li>Netflix gives unlimited maternity and paternity for the first year</li>\n<li>Asana gives each employee a $10k allowance to spend on computers and desk decor</li>\n<li>Full-time workers at Evernote get to have their house cleaned twice a month for free</li>\n<li>Zillow gives all employees Fitbits and has a communal treadmill desk in every office</li>\n</ul><p>But I got to thinking ‚Äì do fancy startup job perks actually help make employees happy?</p>\n<p>I think not. Here‚Äôs why.</p>\n<h2>The perk war</h2>\n<p>There are two types of job perks: the basic shit and the fancy shit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/xfancybasicgraph.jpg.pagespeed.ic.kCO-tk5yju.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>The basic shit is a decent salary, medical and dental benefits, a 401k, a work computer, and maybe free lunches once in a while. </p>\n<p>The fancy shit are the lavish things you read about online: a free puppy, sleeping pods, free onsite laundry, yoga classes, unlimited vacation, office arcade, office bar, in-office massages, free iPads, four day work weeks, and ping pong tables.  </p>\n<p>Companies are increasingly using fancy shit to convince talented people to join their team. </p>\n<p>Offering employees fancy shit a is relatively new concept, and because of that, it‚Äôs easy to over prioritize the fancy shit over the basic shit.</p>\n<p>And so, employers have to decide what type of company they want to create.</p>\n<p>But here‚Äôs the thing: your work happiness is determined by the sum of the two shits. Really. Here‚Äôs the two-shits breakdown.</p>\n<p>Option A is simple, without all the glitz and glamour. They emphasize stuff like passion, curiosity, and camaraderie without defining themselves by perks.</p>\n<h6>OPTION A</h6>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/xheadphones01.jpg.pagespeed.ic.o5Nkqj53xX.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Option B is icing heavy and cake light. Their sales pitch leads with gourmet chefs, flexible PTO, and the promises of a work/life balance. The basic shit is assumed and included as an afterthought.</p>\n<h6>OPTION B</h6>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/xheadphones02.jpg.pagespeed.ic.Sf1qII35xk.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Now, when you‚Äôre a 21-year-old recent grad deciding between Option A and Option B , it‚Äôs easy to let the perks convince you. </p>\n<p>But you shouldn‚Äôt.</p>\n<h2>Why fancy shit won‚Äôt make you happy</h2>\n<p>Let‚Äôs say you have two job offers on the table. </p>\n<p>The first is at a company called AltPad, an iPad gaming company that has created a game that they hope will slow down early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs. You‚Äôve been passionate about potentially curing illnesses for a while, but it‚Äôs an early startup, so they don‚Äôt have a lot of the fancy shit you read about in the news. It‚Äôs a livable and competitive salary, so that‚Äôs nice. They aren‚Äôt really known though, so you‚Äôll have to constantly explain ‚Äú<a href=\"http://thehustle.co/why-millennials-are-unhappy\" target=\"_blank\">what you do</a>‚Äù when your friends ask. </p>\n<p>The other company you have an offer from is a social network called Schmoogle. It is consistently voted one of the best places to work because it has all the fancy shit you can imagine: free food, on site laundry service, and dozens of sleeping pods scattered throughout the office. </p>\n<p>Even though you may not use Schmoogle‚Äôs product or be passionate about it, you‚Äôll be the envy of your friends.</p>\n<p>So because you‚Äôre a young buck who‚Äôs hungry to conquer the world and impress your friends, you take the job at Schmoogle with all the fancy shit. </p>\n<p>It doesn‚Äôt really matter if you‚Äôre not really into their product because it‚Äôll be a helluva lot of fun. And your parents will brag about you because you work at the place in Owen Wilson‚Äôs next rom-com.</p>\n<center><img src=\"/assets/xheadphones03.jpg.pagespeed.ic.JkP7_DtAPU.jpg\"/></center>\n<h2>Your first week at Schmoogle!</h2>\n<p>So you take the fancy job and have your first week at Schmoogle. It‚Äôs freaking awesome. It feels like you‚Äôre back in college! You spend lunch time in the cafe meeting new friends, ride bikes during the break time, and get tons of new supplies like a Macbook Air, a fancy monitor, and a new phone. ‚ÄúGod, this is awesome,‚Äù you think. </p>\n<p>Then, in your second week, work starts. You knew it was coming, but the first week was so much fun that you totally forgot about it. And, as it just so happens, during your first week of real work the cafe at Schmoogle runs out of Cinnamon Toast Crunch, your favorite cereal.</p><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" readability=\"87.1150219987\"><div class=\"img-full-screen alignnone size-full\"><div><div readability=\"9\"><p>How are we doing so far? Just a friendly reminder to subscribe to our weekly email list for future episodes. Thanks, carry on.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n<p>When you ask the kitchen staff if they plan on restocking soon, they say that because of the CEO‚Äôs new gluten allergy they‚Äôll no longer be having Cinnamon Toast Crunch. </p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not like you started working at Schmoogle because of the free cereal, but it certainly didn‚Äôt hurt. </p>\n<p>Again, not a big deal, but Schmoogle just went down a little bit in your book.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/xheadphones04.jpg.pagespeed.ic.qtCKx8_vv6.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>A few weeks after the Cinnamon Toast Crunch incident, you visit your friend at another fancyshit company called Spitter. </p>\n<p>Holy crap, you say to yourself, their gym is HUGE. Schmoogle only has 10 ellipticals and most of the time they‚Äôre being used, but Spitter has 20. Wow. </p>\n<p>You know, it kinda puts things in perspective. If Schmoogle really cared about you, they‚Äôd have at least as many ellipticals as Spitter. </p>\n<p>Strike two, Schmoogle.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/xheadphones05.jpg.pagespeed.ic.wwPTljjzXL.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>One morning, a few months after your visit to Spitter, you get a memo from the head of HR.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúDear Schmoogle employees, because of a lack of attendance, Thursday night yoga classes are now canceled.‚Äù</p>\n<p>For the love of God. Are you fucking kidding me Schmoogle? The one thing reason why you look forward to coming to work on Thursdays has just been canceled. Why do you hate me so much? Look, if you were going to cancel yoga, you could have at LEAST given me a warning ahead of time so I could have signed up for spinning class. FUCK.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/xheadphones06.jpg.pagespeed.ic.DBWn-7yYT7.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>A few weeks after the infamous yoga incident, your boss tells you that they‚Äôre flying you to Germany for the launch of a new product. Whew ‚Äî this will give you a chance to unwind and get happy. </p>\n<p>But then you look at your itinerary and notice that you‚Äôre flying economy, not business class, which you usually do.</p>\n<p>‚ÄúHey it looks like there‚Äôs an error on my ticket,‚Äù you tell your manager. </p>\n<p>‚ÄúWe had to make a few cutbacks this quarter, but don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll still have your own hotel room.‚Äù</p>\n<p>You hate your life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/xheadphones07.jpg.pagespeed.ic.K9bksnnM3t.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>On Monday you get back from Germany and head to work. You‚Äôre still a bit jet lagged but you show up to work early. You decide to make a piece of toast with honey and peanut butter. That‚Äôll make you feel better. </p>\n<p>As you make the toast, you notice that they have a new type of honey. Wait, this isn‚Äôt organic?!</p>\n<p>I‚Äôm done with this shit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/xheadphones08.jpg.pagespeed.ic.k9VJBhw2wo.jpg\"/></p>\n<hr/><p>You see, you set yourself up to fail when you pick a job based on the perks.  It‚Äôs like marrying someone because they have a Ferrari and a mansion with a swimming pool. And as you may know, fate doesn‚Äôt always treat gold digger‚Äôs kindly. Because when shit goes down, so do they.</p>\n<p>So, if you ever have to decide between the fancy shit or the basic shit, make sure to put most of the emphasis on the basic shit, not whether or not they give out free headphones.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/xheadphones10.jpg.pagespeed.ic.znOql1xuk1.jpg\"/><br/><img src=\"/assets/xheadphones09.jpg.pagespeed.ic.PjOMWSWCVF.jpg\"/></p>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-16\" readability=\"8.82352941176\"><hr/><strong>A note from The Hustle:</strong> We want to teach everything we know about writing attention-grabbing, irresistible copy.

Consequently, they are the ones whose jobs are least likely to be taken by intelligent machines.

When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still has a shot: ad answer may come to mind quickly-but it is not an answer to the original question.

	(8,'https://hbr.org/2012/09/boring-is-productive.html','Boring Is Productive','<div readability=\"128.188616535\">\n					<p>Whatever you think of his politics, you have to admit that Barack Obama has a very demanding schedule. The president‚Äôs typical day might include a ceremony celebrating Team USA‚Äôs Olympic athletes, meetings with his cabinet and military advisors, several speeches to campaign supporters, and phone calls with foreign leaders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama\">In an article for October‚Äôs Vanity Fair</a>, author Michael Lewis explored some of these behind-the-scenes details of President Obama‚Äôs daily life. To prepare for the article, Lewis spent six months in close company of the president ‚Äî playing in his high-energy basketball games, sitting up front in Air Force One, and chatting with him whenever the president had a free moment.</p>\n<p>There was one particular question that Lewis asked repeatedly of President Obama. Lewis presented the president with the following scenario: ‚ÄúAssume that in thirty minutes you will stop being president. I will take your place. Prepare me. Teach me how to be president.‚Äù</p>\n<p>The president first touted the necessity of daily exercise ‚Äî a habit that I endorse wholeheartedly. But what he said next was even more interesting: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see I wear only gray or blue suits. I‚Äôm trying to pare down decisions. I don‚Äôt want to make decisions about what I‚Äôm eating or wearing. Because I have too many other decisions to make.‚Äù</p>\n<p>I share President Obama‚Äôs practice of ‚Äúroutinizing the routine.‚Äù I eat essentially the same thing for breakfast each morning: a bowl of cold cereal and a banana. For lunch, I eat a chicken salad sandwich with a diet soda. Each morning, I dress in one of a small number of suits, each of which goes with particular shirts and ties.</p>\n<p>Why do President Obama and I subject ourselves to such boring routines? Because both of us (especially President Obama!) make many decisions each day ‚Äî decisions that are far more important to us than what we wear or what we eat for breakfast.</p>\n<p><strong>Making too many decisions about mundane details is a waste of a limited resource: your mental energy.</strong> In the late 1990s, Roy Baumeister (a professor at Florida State University) and colleagues performed <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/74/5/1252/\">several experiments</a> showing that certain types of conscious mental actions appeared to draw from the same ‚Äúenergy source‚Äù ‚Äî gradually diminishing our ability to make smart decisions throughout the day.</p>\n<p>In one of Baumeister‚Äôs experiments, subjects were forced to eat a pair of radishes instead of the freshly baked, aromatic chocolate chip cookies sitting on the same table. In another, subjects were instructed to suppress their emotional reactions to a comedic or tragic film. In both cases, those subjects were quicker (relative to control groups) to give up on a problem-solving task that followed, suggesting that their previous acts of self-control and self-regulation ‚Äî eating the radishes or maintaining a stoic appearance ‚Äî had depleted their mental resources.</p>\n<p>Over the past fifteen years, many researchers have replicated these experiments with slight variations, trying to discover which types of mental actions most quickly deplete our mental resources, and what some consequences of this depleted state might be. Chapter four in Dan Ariely‚Äôs new book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone-Especially/dp/0062183591\">The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty</a> summarizes some fascinating experiments that show that a tired brain makes us more likely to eat junk food, lie, or otherwise exhibit poor self-control.</p>\n<p>Of particular interest to me (and, apparently, President Obama) are <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/94/5/883/\">a series of experiments run by Kathleen Vohs</a> (an associate business professor at the University of Minnesota) and colleagues, including Professor Baumeister.</p>\n<p>Vohs‚Äôs experiments tested whether everyday choices ‚Äî which candy bar to eat or what clothes to buy, for instance ‚Äî wear down our mental energy. The results? Vohs and colleagues consistently found that making repeated choices depleted the mental energy of their subjects, even if those choices were mundane and relatively pleasant.</p>\n<p>So, if you want to be able to have more mental resources throughout the day, you should identify the aspects of your life that you consider mundane ‚Äî and then ‚Äúroutinize‚Äù those aspects as much as possible. In short, make fewer decisions.</p>\n<p>To me, this means wearing dull clothing and eating the same breakfast and lunch nearly every weekday.

As Vinh writes via email, \"I‚Äôve just been amazed by how vibrant the market for design software has been over the past two years.

To me, that signals a few things. First, software still hasn\'t matured nearly to the level it needs to for this task. There\'s a long way to go, and that also means there\'s tremendous opportunity,\" Vinh writes via email. \"But also, I think that there\'s a huge marketing challenge here: regardless of whether or not you\'re a designer, when it comes time to brainstorm solutions for anything, most people think of pencil and paper as their first resort.

Many of these companies were not always fast growing businesses.</p><p name=\"9d4a\" id=\"9d4a\" class=\"graf--p\">At <a href=\"http://www.shastaventures.com\" data-href=\"http://www.shastaventures.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shasta Ventures</a>, we focus on investing at the early stage, so we studied 32 high value consumer companies to see what they looked like around their Series A. Our research included 25 billion dollar companies (as measured by $1 billion+ last round valuations, acquisition prices, or public market caps) and 7 high-flying private companies with billion dollar potential. <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nbt\" data-href=\"http://www.twitter.com/nbt\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nikhil</a> and I looked at startups across a range of sizes and sectors, considering their funding history, user traction, growth, monetization, network effects, regulatory hurdles, market dynamics, and team characteristics.</p><p name=\"efda\" id=\"efda\" class=\"graf--p\">We found a number of key traits in common, and most of them may surprise you. Let‚Äôs take a look.</p><figure name=\"0102\" id=\"0102\" class=\"graf--figure\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*xyLWya0RvvLemLrHJ3Fwsw.jpeg\" data-width=\"1650\" data-height=\"1275\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*xyLWya0RvvLemLrHJ3Fwsw.jpeg\" src=\"https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*xyLWya0RvvLemLrHJ3Fwsw.jpeg\"/></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\">Note: the companies used in this research were not meant to be a comprehensive list. The criteria used to pick this list of companies was A) consumer-oriented applications or services, B) Series A funding rounds after 2007, C) US-based. This list is segmented by companies‚Äô valuation in the ranges stated, as measured by latest private round valuation (estimated), or acquisition price, or public market valuation.</figcaption></figure><h3 name=\"0b59\" id=\"0b59\" class=\"graf--h3\">1. Easy-to-Dismiss Ideas</h3><p name=\"bcce\" id=\"bcce\" class=\"graf--p\">Once companies reach the billion dollar club, their basic idea and value proposition seem obvious, but this was not always the case in their early days.</p><p name=\"a97d\" id=\"a97d\" class=\"graf--p\">Our analysis discovered that many billion dollar companies have ideas that were easy to dismiss at first. How many people really ride in black cars? Who really wants to watch live video streaming of people playing video games? Why does anyone care about yet another cloud backup and sync service? Photo messages‚Ä¶ that disappear?!?! How many people are interested in renting a couch in someone‚Äôs home?</p><p name=\"c83e\" id=\"c83e\" class=\"graf--p\">Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky has <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2014/01/28/silicon-valley-didnt-think-a-designer-could-build-a-company-interview-airbnb-co-founder-brian-chesky/\" data-href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2014/01/28/silicon-valley-didnt-think-a-designer-could-build-a-company-interview-airbnb-co-founder-brian-chesky/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">discussed this openly</a>:</p><blockquote name=\"36d6\" id=\"36d6\" class=\"graf--blockquote\">When we came to the Valley, no one even wanted to invest in Airbnb. One of the reasons was they thought the idea was crazy. People thought I‚Äôd never stay in a stranger‚Äôs home. That‚Äôs creepy.</blockquote><p name=\"7f10\" id=\"7f10\" class=\"graf--p\">It turns out that the biggest ideas are not clear when you first see or hear them, either because the idea seems small, regulations are high, or the fundamental assumption seems flawed. However, successful companies often start with executing very well on an initial concept that is the beginning to a much bigger offering.</p><h3 name=\"4100\" id=\"4100\" class=\"graf--h3\">2. Competitive Markets</h3><p name=\"c51a\" id=\"c51a\" class=\"graf--p\">Conventional wisdom would say that successful start-ups go into wide open spaces with bold new ideas. However, we found the opposite to be true. Most of the billion dollar companies we examined are in highly competitive markets.</p><p name=\"9bd7\" id=\"9bd7\" class=\"graf--p\">Take messaging for example. There were plenty of ways to communicate before Snapchat or WhatsApp, but these startups still managed to experience breakout success despite the stiff competition. The social and communication sector actually had the highest concentration of billion dollar companies in our survey.</p><p name=\"bf70\" id=\"bf70\" class=\"graf--p\">Another good example is the marketplaces sector, which includes companies like Uber, Airbnb, Eventbrite, and Instacart. There were certainly ways to get cabs, find lodging, organize events, or get groceries delivered before any of these startups came along, and yet these companies delivered a better offering and grew like wildfire.</p><p name=\"a053\" id=\"a053\" class=\"graf--p\">The key learning is that consumers are willing to embrace superior products and experiences. It is also clear that large existing markets are ripe for disruption by tech enabled companies that create new ways to serve the customer.</p><h3 name=\"1cb4\" id=\"1cb4\" class=\"graf--h3\">3. Reinventing Existing Consumer Behavior</h3><p name=\"c1d2\" id=\"c1d2\" class=\"graf--p\">We found that billion dollar consumer companies generally reinvent existing behavior with a superior consumer experience, rather than bringing something radical and novel to the market.</p><p name=\"b0a0\" id=\"b0a0\" class=\"graf--p\">Companies like Nextdoor, Square, Zulily, and others have given consumers new ways to do things they were already doing‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääconnecting with neighbors, paying with credit cards, and buying kids products online. Each company‚Äôs success stemmed from a unique insight it had about the customer that spawned a better experience.</p><p name=\"fd74\" id=\"fd74\" class=\"graf--p\">Dropbox was just easier to use than other backup/storage/sync solutions, and far better than the USB drive/self-email status quo. Tumblr built an engaged community around content, which may not seem like a big deal at first, but really differentiated its product. Nest built a thermostat that was connected to the Internet, better designed, and more effective at saving energy. Uber has reimagined the model for a transportation company, presenting an infinitely more convenient and enjoyable way to get around town.</p><h3 name=\"649e\" id=\"649e\" class=\"graf--h3\">4. Untested Founders</h3><p name=\"8117\" id=\"8117\" class=\"graf--p\">Surprisingly, it is most often untested founders, rather than experienced entrepreneurs, who are at the helm of large, fast growing companies.</p><p name=\"b6bb\" id=\"b6bb\" class=\"graf--p\">Three-out-of-four of the companies in our survey were built and run by people who were doing it for the first time. They did not have a win under their belt or deep experience in their field, but were passionate about their product and had a unique perspective on how to serve their target customer. Having a fresh perspective is important in tackling a category as people with industry experience are often constrained by what is ‚Äúnot possible‚Äù and why it ‚Äúwon‚Äôt work‚Äù.</p><h3 name=\"9f85\" id=\"9f85\" class=\"graf--h3\">5. Zero Monetization</h3><p name=\"6265\" id=\"6265\" class=\"graf--p\">Another interesting finding is that many of the billion dollar companies were not monetizing their customers at the time of their Series A round, including Twitter, Pinterest, Houzz, and Nextdoor. At this stage, they were focused on building a user base rather than making money. These startups first focused on nailing their customer proposition and increasing adoption and engagement. Once they had established themselves firmly in the market and reached massive scale, then they started to think about revenue.</p><p name=\"1205\" id=\"1205\" class=\"graf--p\">While most companies did not have revenue early on, we found that many that grow to significant scale did have signs of strong product/market fit and/or exhibited strong network effects by their Series A round.</p><p name=\"50cb\" id=\"50cb\" class=\"graf--p\">If this study made anything clear, it is that potentially big ideas are often not obvious at the Series A stage.</p><p name=\"82ab\" id=\"82ab\" class=\"graf--p\">Some startups that seem poised for greatness go on to crash-and-burn, while others that are slow to get off the ground surprise everyone with their triumph. There is no formula, expectations are often wrong, and each success story is unique and unprecedented‚Ä¶ but that doesn‚Äôt mean there are not patterns worth paying attention to.</p><p name=\"c017\" id=\"c017\" class=\"graf--p\">Our analysis did reveal one clear, underlying theme:</p><h4 name=\"5428\" id=\"5428\" class=\"graf--h4 graf--last\">There are large companies to be built by offering new, innovative and superior customer experiences to large markets, regardless of how competitive the sector already is or how successful the founders have been before.</h4></div>','1','https-medium-com-keep-learning-keep-growing-what-did-billion-dollar-companies-look-like-at-the-series-a-e53ea8043a85','medium.com','766d8ba639c66943dc2aaffe02ded11b','0','2015-09-19 18:52:57','2015-09-19 18:52:57'),

The Polymer project is a larger framework which allows you to create client-side¬†applications and incorporates¬†mobile-ready design.</p>\n\n<h3>6. New JavaScript features</h3>\n<ul><li>WebGL 3D will become¬†increasingly popular as browsers continue to increase in speed and capability. Powered by frameworks like <a title=\"Three.js WebGL framework\" href=\"http://threejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">three.js</a>, we hope to see more applications of this awesome technology in-browser.</li>\n<li>HTML5 JavaScript APIs will¬†have¬†increased support in iOS and Android browsers</li>\n<li><a title=\"ServiceWorker API\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker_API\" target=\"_blank\">ServiceWorker</a> magic for offline web-app use</li>\n<li><a title=\"Exciting new JavaScript for easy data-binding\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/observe\" target=\"_blank\">Object.observe</a> ‚Äì revolutionising two-way data binding in JavaScript MV* frameworks</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"http://threejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4030 size-full\" src=\"http://www.zingdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/three-js.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of some of the work done using the three JS library\" width=\"580\" height=\"321\"/></a></p>\n\n<h3>7. Web API</h3>\n<p>More app developers will build web¬†APIs, utilised by their web app <em>and </em>their native apps. This is already starting to happen, and will almost certainly increase in popularity as a single codebase is a lot¬†easier to maintain.</p>\n\n<h3>8. Single page applications</h3>\n<p>Following the growth¬†in popularity of the above-mentioned technologies, I expect we‚Äôll see more single page applications being produced. In the new year I hope to see more¬†solutions to some of <a title=\"Single-page Applications\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application#Challenges_with_the_SPA_model\" target=\"_blank\">the challenges</a> which building these apps¬†present.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4034 size-full\" src=\"http://www.zingdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/topeka-built-with-polymer1.png\" alt=\"A screenshot of a quiz game called Topeka, which was built using the Polymer Project\" width=\"580\" height=\"410\"/></p>\n\n<h3>9. The rise of Instagram</h3>\n<p><a title=\"Instagram\" href=\"http://instagram.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> recently passed¬†Twitter in their number of users, does this mean a movement away from micro-blogging and an increase in the popularity of image sharing applications? We hope to see more creative ways to share images and videos as new technology becomes available. We should also keep an eye out for developments and trends within other image-based sharing applications like <a title=\"Pinterest\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest</a> and <a title=\"SnapChat\" href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SnapChat</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4033 size-full\" src=\"http://www.zingdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/instagram1.png\" alt=\"Instagram logo text on a multi-coloured background\" width=\"580\" height=\"290\"/></p>\n\n<h3>10. The Internet of Things (IoT)</h3>\n<p>The Internet of Things is the network of physical objects that contains embedded technology in order for them to communicate and interact with their environments and each other. More devices are becoming network-accessible, so as web developers, we‚Äôll¬†be tasked with coming up with new solutions¬†to help users control and communicate with their¬†cars, heat pumps, ovens, toasters and¬†<a title=\"Yes. Bluetooth plant communication. It\'s a thing.\" href=\"http://www.parrot.com/usa/products/flower-power/\" target=\"_blank\">plants</a>.</p>\n<p>Many companies such as <a title=\"Smart Things Smart Home Kit\" href=\"https://shop.smartthings.com/#!/kits/smart-home-starter-kit\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Things</a> and <a title=\"Littlebits Smart Home Kit\" href=\"http://littlebits.cc/kits/smart-home-kit\" target=\"_blank\">LittleBits</a> already have kits that make your house¬†appliances smart so in¬†2015, we predict that IoT software platforms will continue to¬†displace hardware. Although much of the early hype has been about high-tech wearables and wireless technologies,¬†this year¬†we predict that we will see an increased focus on the software and especially the cloud services to make all these sensors connect, upload data, and drive analytics that generate¬†insights and enable efficiencies and communications across the business.</p>\n<p>The IoT movement is so huge that recently Google‚Äôs chairman Eric¬†Schmidt <a title=\"Eric Schmidt Internet will disappear\" href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/google-chairman-eric-schmidt-internet-765989\" target=\"_blank\">predicted</a> that internet will ‚Äúsimply disappear in the future‚Äù as it becomes ‚Äúpart of your presence all the time‚Äù.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4117\" src=\"http://www.zingdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/internet-of-things.png\" alt=\"internet-of-things\" width=\"580\" height=\"410\"/></p>\n            					</div>','1','zingdesign-com-top-10-web-development-trends-and-predictions-for-2015','zingdesign.com','484371e3d230f8fa27c489fb2f09395e','0','2015-09-19 20:44:22','2015-09-19 20:44:22'),

Skirt lengths rise and fall, pigments come and go, ties get fatter, then thinner. But in the world of technology, rigor, science, math, and precision rule over fad.</p><p>That\'s not to say programming is a profession devoid of trends. The difference is that programming trends are driven by greater efficiency, increased customization, and ease-of-use. The new technologies that deliver one or more of these eclipse the previous generation. It\'s a meritocracy, not a whimsy-ocracy.</p><p><strong>[ Work smarter, not harder -- download the <a href=\"http://infoworld.com/d/application-development/special-report-infoworlds-developers-survival-guide-191338?source=ifwelg_fssr\">Developers\' Survival Guide</a> from InfoWorld for all the tips and trends programmers need to know. | Keep up with the latest developer news with InfoWorld\'s <a href=\"http://infoworld.com/newsletters/subscribe?showlist=infoworld_developer&amp;source=ifwelg_fssr\">Developer World newsletter</a>. ]</strong></p><p>What follows is a list of what\'s hot -- and what\'s not -- among today\'s programmers. Not everyone will agree with what\'s A-listed, what\'s D-listed, and what\'s been left out. But that\'s what makes programming an endlessly fascinating profession: rapid change, passionate debate, sudden comebacks.</p><aside class=\"nativo-promo smartphone\" id=\"\"/><p><strong>Hot: Preprocessors<br/>Not: Full language stacks</strong><br/>It wasn\'t long ago that people who created a new programming language had to build everything that turned code into the bits fed to the silicon. Then someone figured out they could piggyback on the work that came before. Now people with a clever idea just write a preprocessor that translates the new code into something old with a rich set of libraries and APIs.</p><p>The folks who loved dynamic typing <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/groovy-the-roadmap-the-popular-jvm-language-202990\">created Groovy</a>, a simpler version of Java without the overly insistent punctuation. Those who wanted to fix JavaScript created CoffeeScript, a preprocessor that lets them to code, again, without the onerous punctuation. There seem to be <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/epic-codefest-7-programming-languages-in-7-days-213553\">dozens of languages like Scala or Clojure</a> that run on the JVM, but there\'s only one JVM. Why reinvent the wheel?</p><p><strong>Hot: JavaScript MV* frameworks<br/>Not: JavaScript files</strong><br/>Long ago, everyone learned to write JavaScript to pop up an alert box or check to see that the email address in the form actually contained an @ sign. Now HTML AJAX apps are so sophisticated that few people start from scratch. It\'s simpler to adopt an elaborate framework and write a bit of glue code to implement your business logic. There are now <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/the-10-hottest-javascript-framework-projects-228335\">dozens of frameworks</a> like Kendo, Sencha, jQuery Mobile, AngularJS, Ember, Backbone, Meteor JS, and many more -- all ready to handle the events and content for your Web apps and pages.</p><p><strong>Hot: CSS frameworks<br/>Not: Generic Cascading Style Sheets</strong><br/>Once upon a time, adding a bit of pizzazz to a Web page meant opening the CSS file and including a new command like <code>font-style:italic</code>. Then you saved the file and went to lunch after a hard morning\'s work. Now Web pages are so sophisticated that it\'s impossible to fill a file with such simple commands. One tweak to a color and everything goes out of whack. It\'s like they say about conspiracies and ecologies: Everything is connected.</p><aside class=\"nativo-promo tablet desktop\" id=\"\"/><p>That\'s where CSS frameworks like SASS and its cousins Compass have found solid footing. They encourage literate, stable coding by offering programming constructs such as real variables, nesting blocks, and mix-ins. It may not sound like much newness in the programming layer, but it\'s a big leap forward for the design layer.</p><p><strong>Hot: SVG + JavaScript on Canvas<br/>Not: Flash<br/></strong>Flash has been driving people crazy for years, but the artists have always loved the results. The antialiased rendering looks great and many talented artists have built a deep stack of Flash code to offer sophisticated transitions and animations.</p><p>Now that the JavaScript layer has the ability to do much of the same, browser manufacturers and developers are cheering for the end of Flash. They see better integration with the DOM layer coming from new formats like SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). The SVG and HTML comprise one big pile of tags, and that\'s often easier for Web developers to use. Then there are large APIs that offer elaborate drawing on the Canvas object, often with the help of video cards. Put them together and there few reasons to use Flash anymore.</p><p><strong>Hot: Almost big data (analysis without Hadoop)<br/>Not: Big data (with Hadoop)</strong><br/>Everyone likes to feel like the Big Man on Campus, and if they aren\'t, they\'re looking for a campus of the appropriate size where they can stand out. So it\'s no surprise that when the words \"big data\" started flowing through the executive suite, the suits started asking for the biggest, most powerful b<a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/slideshow/131105/18-essential-hadoop-tools-crunching-big-data-232123\">ig data systems</a> as if they were purchasing a yacht or a skyscraper.</p><p>The funny thing is, many problems aren\'t big enough to use the fanciest big data solutions. Sure, companies like Google or Yahoo track all of our Web browsing; they have data files measured in petabytes or yottabytes. But most companies have data sets that can easily fit in the RAM of a basic PC. I\'m writing this on a PC with 16GB of RAM -- enough for a billion events with a handful of bytes. In most algorithms, the data doesn\'t need to be read into memory because streaming it from an SSD is fine.</p><p>There will be instances that demand the fast response times of dozens of machines in a Hadoop cloud running in parallel, but many will do just fine plugging along on a single machine without the hassles of coordination or communication.</p><p><strong>Hot: Game frameworks<br/>Not: Native game development</strong><br/>Once upon a time, game development meant hiring plenty of developers who wrote everything in C from scratch. Sure it cost a bazillion dollars, but it looked great. Now, no one can afford the luxury of custom code. Most games developers gave up their pride years ago and use libraries like Unity, Corona, or LibGDX to build their systems. They don\'t write C code as much as instructions for the libraries. Is it a shame that our games aren\'t handcrafted with pride but stamped out using the same engine? Most of the developers are relieved -- because they don\'t have to deal with the details, they can concentrate on the game play, narrative arc, characters, and art.</p><p><strong>Hot: Single-page Web apps<br/>Not: Websites</strong><br/>Remember when URLs pointed to Web pages filled with static text and images? How simple and quaint to put all information in a network of separate Web pages called a website. New Web apps are front ends to large databases filled with content. When the Web app wants information, it pulls it from the database and pours it into the local mold. There\'s no need to mark up the data with all the Web extras needed to build a Web page. The data layer is completely separate from the presentation and formatting layer. Here, the rise of mobile computing is another factor: a single, responsive-designed Web page that work like an app -- all the better to avoid the turmoil of the app stores.</p><p><strong>Hot: Mobile Web apps<br/>Not: Native mobile apps</strong><br/>Let\'s say you have a great idea for some mobile content. You could rush off and write separate versions for iOS, Android, Windows 8, and maybe even BlackBerry OS or one of the others. Each requires a separate team speaking a different programming language. Then each platform\'s app store exerts its own pound of flesh before the app can be delivered to the users. Or you could just build one HTML app and put it on a website to run on all the platforms. If there\'s a change, you don\'t need to return to the app store, begging for a quick review of a bug fix. Now that the HTML layer is getting faster and running on faster chips, this approach can compete with native apps better on even more complicated and interactive apps.</p><p><strong>Hot: Android<br/>Not: iOS</strong><br/>Was it only a few years ago that lines snaked out of Apple\'s store? Times change. While the iPhone and iPad continue to have dedicated fans who love their rich, sophisticated UI, the raw sales numbers favor Android more and more. Some reports even say that more than 70 percent of phones sold were Androids.</p><p>The reason may be as simple as price. While iOS devices maintain a hefty price, the Android world is flooded with plenty of competition that\'s producing tablets for as low as one-fifth the price. Saving money is always a temptation.</p><p>But another factor may be the effect of open source. Anyone can compete in the marketplace -- and they do. There are big Android tablets and little ones. There are Android cameras and even Android refrigerators. No one has to say, \"Mother, may I?\" to Google to innovate. If they have an idea, they follow their mind.</p><p><strong>Hot: GPU<br/>Not: CPU</strong><br/>When software was simple and the instructions were arranged in a nice line, the CPU was king of the computer because it did all of the heavy lifting. Now that video games are filled with extensive graphical routines that can run in parallel, the video card runs the show. It\'s easy to spend $500, $600, or more on a fancy video card, and some serious gamers use more than one. That\'s more than double the price of many basic desktops. Gamers aren\'t the only ones bragging about their GPU cards. Computer scientists are now converting many parallel applications to run hundreds of times faster on the GPU.</p><p><strong>Hot: GitHub<br/>Not: R√©sum√©s</strong><br/>Sure, you could learn something by reading a puffed-up list of accomplishments that include vice president of the junior high chess club. But <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/t/it-management/how-do-you-land-it-job-show-dont-tell-224869\">reading someone\'s actual code</a> is so much richer and more instructive. Do they write good comments? Do they waste too much time breaking things into tiny classes that do little? Is there a real architecture with room for expansion? All these questions can be answered by a glimpse at some code.</p><p>This is why participating in open source projects is becoming more and more important for finding a job. Sharing the code from a proprietary project is hard, but open source code can go everywhere.</p><p><strong>Hot: Renting<br/>Not: Buying</strong><br/>When Amazon rolled out its sales for computers and other electronics on Black Friday, the company forgot to include hype-worthy <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/review-amazon-the-mother-of-all-clouds-214375?source=fssr\">deals for its cloud</a>. Give it time. Not so long ago, companies opened their own data center and hired their own staff to run the computers they purchased outright. Now they rent the computers, the data center, the staff, and even the software by the hour. No one wants the hassles of owning anything. It\'s all a good idea, at least until the website goes viral and you realize you\'re paying for everything by the click. Now if only Amazon finds a way to <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/t/cringely/amazons-world-domination-moves-air-assault-phase-231951\">deliver the cloud with its drones</a>, the trends will converge.</p><p><strong>Hot: Web interfaces<br/>Not: IDEs</strong><br/>A long time ago, people used a command-line compiler. Then someone integrated that with an editor and other tools to create the IDE. Now it\'s time for the IDE to be eclipsed (ha) by browser-based tools that let you edit the code, often of a working system. If you don\'t like how WordPress works, it comes with a built-in editor that lets you change the code right then and there. Microsoft\'s Azure lets you write JavaScript glue code right in its portal. These systems don\'t offer the best debugging environments and there\'s something dangerous about editing production code, but the idea has legs.</p><p><strong>Hot: Node.js<br/>Not: JavaEE, Ruby on Rails, PHP</strong><br/>The server world has always thrived on the threaded model that let the operating system indulge any wayward, inefficient, or dissolute behavior by programmers. Whatever foolish loop or wasteful computation programmers coded, the OS would balance performance by switching between the threads.</p><p>Then <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/slideshow/131906/beyond-the-web-10-surprising-nodejs-projects-232369\">Node.js came along</a> with the JavaScript callback model of programming, and the code ran really fast -- faster than anyone expected was possible from a toy language once used only for alert boxes. Suddenly the overhead of creating new threads became obvious and Node.js took off. Problems arise when programmers don\'t behave well, but the responsibility has largely been good for them. Making resource constraints obvious to programmers usually produces faster code.</p><p>The Node.js world also benefits from offering harmony between browser and server. The same code runs on both making it easier for developers to move around features and duplicate functionality. As a result, Node.js layers have become the hottest stacks on the Internet.</p><p><strong>Hot: Hackerspaces<br/>Not: College</strong><br/>One <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/200k-computer-science-degree-or-these-free-online-classes-218565\">costs $250,000 for four years</a>. The other charges about $50 a month, with big discounts for paying in advance. One uses the money to buy football stadiums, fancy houses for the president, flashy dorms, and four-color magazines. The other buys 3D printers, oscilloscopes, soldering irons, and more.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/d/application-development/why-you-should-care-about-your-local-hackerspace-221628\">Hackerspaces</a> are stepping up to nurture innovation without the outrageous overhead of the college industrial complex. They are creating the social networks that spawn startups and build wealth but without the bureaucracy and foolish consistencies Emerson called the \"hobgoblin of little minds.\" Courses don\'t need to last an entire semester. Students don\'t need to start campaigning for admission a year before starting to learn. The ad-hoc nature is fast proving better suited for the rapidly moving world of technology.</p><p><strong>Related articles</strong></p></div>','1','infoworld-com-article-2609017-application-development-application-development-15-hot-programming-trends-and-15-going-cold-html','infoworld.com','36b93a294b4de1181e2b2e68a737f4f6','0','2015-09-19 20:46:45','2015-09-19 20:46:45'),

I have been working on Web technologies since early 2000, but last few years, I have been mainly involving with Cloud solution architectures. As a Web developer, I have worked on¬†.Net, Node.js and Go technology stacks for developing Web apps and Web services. Recently, I have just looked on the Web technology and development trends as a whole, and I would like to share my thoughts and observations.</p><p name=\"90aa\" id=\"90aa\" class=\"graf--p\">First, let me share some of the current trends I have observed on both usability and architecture.</p><h3 name=\"2ccd\" id=\"2ccd\" class=\"graf--h3\">Trends in Usability</h3><p name=\"bfa0\" id=\"bfa0\" class=\"graf--p\">Now days, user experience is getting more importance than ever before, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design\" data-href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Responsive Web Design (RWD)</strong></a> is becoming a must have feature for web sites. RWD lets the end users browse web sites from multiple form factors, including mobile and tablet browsers. RWD can be replaced for some mobile web sites where we don‚Äôt have to develop separate web site for mobile users. This will work for some scenarios especially for developing web sites mainly focusses on presenting contents. But if you are building Web apps instead of Web sites, which is having lot UI workflows, RWD will not help you. Please keep in mind that Web apps and Web sites are different. Twitter Bootstrap and Zurb Foundation are the most popular RWD frameworks at this moment. If you are building apps that targeting mobile users, I highly recommend for using light-weight frameworks such as <a href=\"http://purecss.io/\" data-href=\"http://purecss.io/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yahoo Pure CSS</a>.</p><h3 name=\"533d\" id=\"533d\" class=\"graf--h3\">Trends in Application Architecture</h3><p name=\"8b2e\" id=\"8b2e\" class=\"graf--p\">A mobile-first strategy in the enterprises, impacted a lot in Web development architecture as well. When organizations are developing Web apps and Web services, they are aligning this with their mobile strategy. Now days, Web APIs are becoming central point of Web apps and Mobile apps, where developers are building RESTful services on the server-side and building the front-end apps for both Web and Mobile, based on the RESTful services.</p><h3 name=\"ae46\" id=\"ae46\" class=\"graf--h3\">The Rise of API Driven Development</h3><p name=\"ab99\" id=\"ab99\" class=\"graf--p\">In the era of Mobile, APIs, often RESTful APIs are becoming a key component of Web apps, and server-side implementations are becoming a thin layer with an API for data and security. These RESTful APIs are not only restricted to Web apps, but can also be used for Mobile apps. So that modern Web developers are writing their server-side code for both Mobile apps and Web apps, which has given more opportunity to Web developers. Another trend in this regard, is the rise of Mobile Backend as a Services (MBaaS) solutions on the Cloud platforms such as <a href=\"https://parse.com/\" data-href=\"https://parse.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parse</a> and <a href=\"http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mobile-services/\" data-href=\"http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mobile-services/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azure Mobile Services</a>. These MBaaS platforms are providing automatic REST APIs against the data models along with many mobile specific back-end services. We can use the MBaaS services for Web apps, since these services are providing RESTful APIs and and also providing JavaScript SDKs for HTML5 clients along with native Mobile SDKs. In future, I strongly believe that MBaaS services will be widely used for both Web apps and Mobile apps.</p><h3 name=\"cc0f\" id=\"cc0f\" class=\"graf--h3\">Emergence of Single Page Applications (SPA)</h3><p name=\"b3a4\" id=\"b3a4\" class=\"graf--p\">When server-side implementations are limited with RESTful APIs, Web front-end development is moved to client-side with desktop like UIs on the browser where developers are rendering the UI on the client-side instead of server-side rendering. In SPA apps, our front-end will be simply using the RESTful API for the data and build the entire UI on the client-side. In this context, JavaScript becomes a key technology for building web apps. One advantage of SPA apps are we can easily package these apps as Mobile apps to multiple mobile platforms using a hybrid mobile container such as <a href=\"http://phonegap.com/\" data-href=\"http://phonegap.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phonegap</a> and <a href=\"https://trigger.io/\" data-href=\"https://trigger.io/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trigger.IO</a>. This is okay for small-size to mid-size Mobile apps where UIs are based on data forms. So we can use a single code base for building Web apps and Mobile apps.</p><p name=\"c1b8\" id=\"c1b8\" class=\"graf--p\">In SPA based Web development, JavaScript is becoming a key technology, and JavaScript skill is more important than ever before. I have developed few SPA apps using different frameworks, and observed some challenges with this model. Here‚Äôs the challenges I have observed with SPA apps:</p><ol class=\"postList\"><li name=\"83a0\" id=\"83a0\" class=\"graf--li\">When we develop large-scale SPA apps, it would be very difficult to maintain the app comparing to everything we do with server-side. I feel that building larger JavaScript apps is really a challenge from the maintainability preservative.</li><li name=\"75a3\" id=\"75a3\" class=\"graf--li\">It would be very difficult to implement complex security models on the client-side, with different kind of authorization roles which is having different levels of access restrictions on the UI.</li></ol><h4 name=\"1430\" id=\"1430\" class=\"graf--h4\">My Observations on the SPA Frameworks</h4><p name=\"1666\" id=\"1666\" class=\"graf--p\">Currently, AngularJS, EmberJS and Backbone are the most popular SPA frameworks used for building real-world apps. I have evaluated these three frameworks and developed apps with it. Based on my experience, AngularJS is more productive framework which is filled with enough features for building larger SPA apps. IMHO, using a MV* framework for front-end development is not a good idea and MVC doesn\'t scale at larger front-end apps. Now, we are using MVC for both server-side and client-side that I don‚Äôt think it as a good practice.</p><h3 name=\"84e6\" id=\"84e6\" class=\"graf--h3\">ReactJS‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAn Awesome Front-End Framework</h3><p name=\"1b8c\" id=\"1b8c\" class=\"graf--p\">When most of the SPA frameworks are living with traditional MVC paradigm, ReactJS provides a different approach for building UI on the client-side. <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/\" data-href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">React</a> is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook and Instagram team, for building user interfaces. The entire front-end of <a href=\"http://instagram.com/\" data-href=\"http://instagram.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram</a> web site and some parts of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a> web site was built with ReactJS. Interestingly, you can use ReactJS with other front-end frameworks such as AngularJS and EmberJS. You can use ReactJS as the view layer along with an MVC framework. But, in practice, I don‚Äôt recommend to use ReactJS with traditional MVC frameworks. ReactJS introduces Virtual DOM, which is awesome part of the ReactJS library and it enables high performance for the rendering the UI. ReactJS provides better performance for the UI rendering than MVC frameworks such as AngularJS and EmberJS. You can build re-usable UI components with the Virtual DOM abstraction and later we can compose these components on the actual DOM. Virtual DOM lets you use React for building UIs outside the browser. For an example, React team at Facebook, building a Objective C bridge for building UIs on iOS apps. For scaling front-end apps, we can use <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html\" data-href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flux</a> architecture with React, which is basically set of architecture practices, that provides data flows in a single direction. I have evaluated BackboneJS, EmberJS, AngularJS and React and I highly recommend React for building user interfaces.</p><h3 name=\"077a\" id=\"077a\" class=\"graf--h3\">Trends in Server-Side Web Technology Stack in 2014</h3><p name=\"b2e8\" id=\"b2e8\" class=\"graf--p\">Few years back, dynamic type languages such as Ruby and Python had been attracted by lot of start-up companies. Ruby on Rails was really a revolution in Web development until few years back. Many start-up companies had developed innovative products in RoR and Python Web frameworks. Now days, the interesting thing is that, these apps are re-engineering to other Web technology stacks due to performance and scalability challenges. Using a dynamic type language for larger apps, is like having a drink with too much sugar. Initially, the sugary feeling would be attractive, but for long period, it can be harmful to the health of apps. This year, we have seen lot of Node.js adoption in the enterprises, especially for building for back-end services for high profile Mobile apps. Larger enterprises such as LinkedIn and Walmart, are using Node.js for powering their Mobile back-end services. As a new technology, Node.js is really a winner in the adoption market of the year 2014. Node.js is a preferred technology stack for building Mobile Backend as a Services (MBaaS) solutions on the Cloud. And this year, we saw lot of Node.js based CLI tools used for front-end development. The rise of Node.js and the fall of Ruby stack are the most notable trends in this year.</p><p name=\"2e39\" id=\"2e39\" class=\"graf--p\">Here‚Äôs the some of the observations on the server-side Web stack:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"4e35\" id=\"4e35\" class=\"graf--li\">Ruby stack in generally and RoR in specifically is losing its momentum and larger Rails apps are re-engineering to other stack.</li><li name=\"cc56\" id=\"cc56\" class=\"graf--li\">The trend of using a dynamic language (Ruby and Python) for Web development is gradually losing its attention.</li><li name=\"8d10\" id=\"8d10\" class=\"graf--li\">Node.js is getting lot of adoption for building back-end RESTful services especially for Mobile space.</li><li name=\"f713\" id=\"f713\" class=\"graf--li\">Emergence of Node.js based CLI tools for front-end development.</li><li name=\"0357\" id=\"0357\" class=\"graf--li\">Microsoft¬†.NET Web stack is going to a big paradigm shift with open specification <a href=\"http://owin.org/\" data-href=\"http://owin.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">OWIN</a> ‚Äì Practically, it is best of both ASP.NET and Node.js.</li><li name=\"09d6\" id=\"09d6\" class=\"graf--li\">Emergence of real-time web apps.</li></ul><h3 name=\"573c\" id=\"573c\" class=\"graf--h3\">Predictions for 2015 and Beyond</h3><p name=\"8b5e\" id=\"8b5e\" class=\"graf--p\">Which technology will dominate in the year 2015? Which technology will lose its momentum? I strongly feel that the era of using dynamic languages for Web development, is going to end. Then, will Node.js continue its momentum in the new technology adoption market? I don‚Äôt think so. Since 2011, I have been mostly writing code in Node.js and had planned for writing a book on the same, but dropped that plan later. Recently, I left from Node.js platform for the following reasons:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"63ab\" id=\"63ab\" class=\"graf--li\">Node.js is always highlighted as a technology for building high performance apps, but it‚Äôs take on Performance over usability and maintainability is the biggest challenge for building larger apps and I predict that many larger Node.js apps will fail with maintainability problem in near future, and the era of hype over Node.js is going to end.</li><li name=\"7d0f\" id=\"7d0f\" class=\"graf--li\">The callback hell. I know that generators and promises are good solutions for solving the callback hell. Framework such as <a href=\"http://koajs.com/\" data-href=\"http://koajs.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--li-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Koa.js</a> provides some kind of solution for the same at the cost of performance impact. But for me, it is hard to solve many of my problem.</li><li name=\"94fe\" id=\"94fe\" class=\"graf--li\">The JavaScript language is also a problem for me. JavaScript is not a good language for building large-scale apps.</li><li name=\"091d\" id=\"091d\" class=\"graf--li\">Node.js is a minimalist platform. For me, it is good for building JSON based REST APIs and real-time systems. I want to develop variety of apps using a single technology stack. The point is that Node.js fails when CPU crunching logic is executes.</li></ul><p name=\"1535\" id=\"1535\" class=\"graf--p\">Some of my problems with Node.js will be the problem of some people and it is having many pragmatic problems with error handling, debugging and usability. I believe that maintainability will be the big challenge of larger Node.js apps. If you are building RESTful services on the Node.js, I highly recommend for using <a href=\"http://hapijs.com/\" data-href=\"http://hapijs.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hapi.js</a> framework, developed by Walmart, which is really a good framework. I greatly appreciate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eranhammer\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/eranhammer\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eran Hammer</a>, who was the creator of Hapi.js.</p><p name=\"f3a1\" id=\"f3a1\" class=\"graf--p\">On 2015, I bet on Go programming language, not just for Web development, but as a technology ecosystem for building distributed apps. For me, Go was far better choice than Node.js. On 2015, I predict that many Ruby and Node.js developers will move to Go.</p><p name=\"fce9\" id=\"fce9\" class=\"graf--p\">Here‚Äôs my few predictions for year 2015 and beyond:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"cf5e\" id=\"cf5e\" class=\"graf--li\">Re-engineering of Rails apps to other stack will reach at peak level for performance-critical web apps.</li><li name=\"cef9\" id=\"cef9\" class=\"graf--li\">The era of using dynamic languages for Web is going to end at least for performance critical apps.</li><li name=\"c732\" id=\"c732\" class=\"graf--li\">Many Node.js apps will suck with maintainability problems. Performance over usability and maintainability might fail for Node.js.</li><li name=\"91a6\" id=\"91a6\" class=\"graf--li\">Go will emerge as a general purpose programming language which will also attract web developer community. Go is a good replacement for both Java and Dynamic language and also for Node.js community.</li><li name=\"b8d1\" id=\"b8d1\" class=\"graf--li\">Go can become the next big language on enterprises after Cobol and Java, but it will take some time. Go is a language of the Cloud era.</li><li name=\"26ce\" id=\"26ce\" class=\"graf--li\">Java and¬†.Net stack will continue its momentum on mid-size to larger enterprise apps, but it will gradually fall on web development.</li></ul><h3 name=\"c235\" id=\"c235\" class=\"graf--h3\">Go¬†: Technology of 2015 and Beyond</h3><p name=\"48d7\" id=\"48d7\" class=\"graf--p graf--last\">Recently lot of good systems are being developed with Go, which are including <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\" data-href=\"https://www.docker.com/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Docker</a>¬†, <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes\" data-href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kubernetes</a>¬†, <a href=\"https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd\" data-href=\"https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">websocketd</a> and <a href=\"http://www.packer.io/\" data-href=\"http://www.packer.io/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Packer.IO</a>. I predict that Go will get lot of attraction from different developer communities including Java, Ruby, Python and Node.js. Go is a static type language while providing the flexibility of dynamic type language‚Äôs productivity. In Go, concurrency is a first class citizen in the core programming language. Like C and C++, Go compiles to native machine code and unlike Java and¬†.Net, it don‚Äôt need any JIT compilation. I fall in love with Go‚Äôs simplicity and it‚Äôs pragmatic design, and the package systems are really good. It may not be good idea to use Go for building traditional Web apps, but it is good for building HTTP servers for providing RESTful services. In future, you might be able to use Go for building Android apps. The advantage of Go is that it is a general purpose programming language, which can be used for any possible scenario‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding systems programming and for larger distributed business apps. I strongly feel that Go is the language of distributed, concurrent and parallel computing in the era of Cloud. Go can become the next Java in the enterprises.</p></div>','1','https-medium-com-shijuvar-web-development-trends-for-2015-and-beyond-c2d3c1ef5718','medium.com','a151c1cb78c9dc3abc075740fee461ef','0','2015-09-19 20:47:25','2015-09-19 20:47:25'),
	(16,'https://jwatt.org/blog/2015/09/14/directory-picking-and-drag-and-drop','New API for directory picking and drag-and-drop','<div property=\"content:encoded\" readability=\"108.979665504\"><p>As part of Mozilla\'s effort to reduce the Web\'s dependency on Flash we have recently been working on a Microsoft proposal called <a href=\"https://wicg.github.io/directory-upload/proposal.html\">Directory Upload</a> to provide directory picking and directory drag-and-drop. (This proposal is a simplification of part of the <a href=\"http://w3c.github.io/filesystem-api/#Directory\">FileSystem API draft</a>, a much more comprehensive set of filesystem APIs.) After providing several rounds of feedback to the Microsoft guys, the Directory Upload proposal has been made available for wider feedback, and we have an implementation enabled in <a href=\"https://nightly.mozilla.org/\">Nightly builds</a> that developers can play with and <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1188880\">file bugs on</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why not copy Chrome\'s directory upload behavior?</h2>\n<p>For those that are aware of it, the obvious question will be why didn\'t we just standardize the behavior introduced with the <code>webkitdirectory</code> attribute for the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element (introduced in Chrome 11, but not available in Safari)? Standardizing that behavior would make it easier for content authors to update existing content that currently uses <code>webkitdirectory</code> to also support non-Chrome browsers in the future.</p>\n<p>With <code>webkitdirectory</code>, when a user picks a directory, all the files under the <i>entire expanded directory tree</i> are added as <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File\"><code>File</code></a> objects to one big, flat <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList\"><code>FileList</code></a>, which is then set on the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element. So it\'s only after the entire directory tree has been traversed that the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/change\"><code>change</code></a> event can be fired to notify the page that the user made a selection and files are available. The advantage of this flat-list approach is that older scripts/libraries that expect a flat list from <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> can more easily be made to work (for example, by adding some awareness of <code>webkitRelativePath</code>). The big downside is that if the number of files in the expanded directory tree is large, then even on machines where I/O is fast it will be a long time before the page is notified via the <code>change</code> event that the user picked something (and that\'s if it doesn\'t hang first due to running out of memory). Until the <code>change</code> event notifies it, the page can\'t even acknowledge that it knows a user selection is incoming, and as a result the user experience can be very poor if I/O is slow or a relatively large directory tree is picked.</p>\n<h2>The Directory Upload proposal\'s behavior</h2>\n<p>The main difference between the <code>webkitdirectory</code> behavior and the Directory Upload proposal is that, instead of populating <code>HTMLInputElement.files</code>, the latter provides a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\"><code>Promise</code></a> that is fulfilled by an array that contains only the <i>immediate</i> <a href=\"https://wicg.github.io/directory-upload/proposal.html#directory-interface\"><code>Directory</code></a>/<code>File</code> objects that the user actually selected. This allows a page to start processing a user\'s selection and provide feedback to the user much sooner. Each <code>Directory</code>\'s direct contents are then only accessed, on demand, via another <code>Promise</code> returning method, allowing the page to incrementally walk the directory tree processing and providing feedback to the user as it goes.</p>\n<p>The text of the <a href=\"https://wicg.github.io/directory-upload/proposal.html#directory-interface\">proposal</a> is short and hopefully readable so I\'d encourage anyone who is interested to take a look, but in summary the main API currently looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>partial interface HTMLInputElement {\n           attribute boolean directory;\n  readonly attribute boolean isFilesAndDirectoriesSupported;\n  Promise&lt;sequence&lt;(File or Directory)&gt;&gt; getFilesAndDirectories ();\n  void                                   chooseDirectory ();\n};</code></pre><pre><code>partial interface Directory {\n  readonly attribute DOMString name;\n  readonly attribute DOMString path;\n  Promise&lt;sequence&lt;(File or Directory)&gt;&gt; getFilesAndDirectories ();\n};</code></pre><p>For those interested in playing with the implementation in Nightly builds, I have a hacked up <a href=\"https://jwatt.org/tmp/directory.html\">demo/test page</a> that uses both the directory picker and drag-and-drop API. For those that are interested in using the API in Chrome, you might find the <a href=\"https://wicg.github.io/directory-upload/polyfill.js\">polyfill</a> that the MS guys wrote useful (Chrome won\'t actually benefit from the incremental tree traversal of course, so picking large directory trees in Chrome is still likely to hang the page).</p>\n<p>(If you do experiment with the API, one thing to note is that the <code>Promise</code> returned by <code>HTMLInputElement.getFilesAndDirectories</code> changes every time the directory picker is used, so you need to call <code>getFilesAndDirectories</code> after the <code>change</code> event has fired rather than calling it speculatively in advance.)</p>\n<h2>Why not put Directory objects in HTMLInputElement.files?</h2>\n<p>Another question some people may ask is why we have the <code>HTMLInputElement.getFilesAndDirectories</code> method when we could put <code>Directory</code> objects in the <code>HTMLInputElement.files</code> <code>FileList</code> for any directories that are directly selected by the user. Again, this is mainly about allowing the <code>change</code> event to fire as soon as possible so a page can acknowledge awareness of a user\'s action promptly. Typically the OS native file/directory pickers that browsers use will notify the browser when a user has picked something by sending/making available a list of paths. However, if the application is going to provide the page with the picked files/directories via <code>HTMLInputElement.files</code> then it is best not to fire the change event at that point. This is because script may iterate over the <code>FileList</code> accessing properties that may require I/O, such as <code>File.size</code>. To avoid blocking on synchronous I/O when script accesses these properties implementations need to look up and cache that information before firing the <code>change</code> event.</p>\n<p>By requiring <code>HTMLInputElement.files</code> to be null when a directory picker is being used, the Directory Upload proposal allows the <code>change</code> event to be fired as soon as the OS native picker provides the list of paths, rather than waiting until the list of File/Directory objects has been created. All the I/O required to create the File/Directory objects needed to resolve the <code>Promise</code> can happen asynchronously after the \'change\' event has fired.</p>\n<h2>Uploading directories</h2>\n<p>While the current Directory Upload proposal requires implementations to submit the files under a picked directory if its <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> is in a form that is submitted, wrapping <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> that the user may submit is likely to be bad practice in general. When a user picks a directory it is much more likely that the number of files to be uploaded will be large. As a result users will be more likely to find a submission taking too long and, if the user doesn\'t abort the submission, it\'s more likely that server limits such as Apache\'s <a href=\"http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.max-file-uploads\">max_file_uploads</a> configuration option will be hit and files will fail to upload.</p>\n<p>In most cases authors should incrementally walk the directory tree and use <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> (or a JS library that wraps it) to upload files individually or in small batches.</p>\n<h2>Future changes</h2>\n<p>One of the reasons that we didn\'t just implement the relevant parts of the <a href=\"http://w3c.github.io/filesystem-api/#Directory\">FileSystem API draft</a> for providing directory picking/drag-and-drop is that the API described there depends on <code>Observable</code>, which is sort of like a <code>Promise</code> but allows a collection of results to arrive bit by bit as they become available. (Actually the FileSystem API should <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/filesystem-api/issues/4\"/>probably change to use <code>AsyncIterator</code>, which is similar to <code>Observable</code> but allow script to pull results bit by bit at its own pace rather than having them pushed on it as soon as they\'re available.) Returning an <code>Observable</code> (or <code>AsyncIterator</code>) instead of a <code>Promise</code> would allow the immediate contents of a Directory to be accessed in small batches, which would further improve user experience when I/O is slow or a directory has a large number of direct contents. Unfortunately the discussion for standardizing Observable and/or AsyncIterator doesn\'t look like it will reach a conclusion any time soon. Providing a <code>Promise</code> returning API now allows the Web to progress, but at some point in the future we may end up adding API like the <a href=\"http://w3c.github.io/filesystem-api/#widl-Directory-enumerate-Observable--File-or-Directory---DOMString-path\"><code>enumerate</code></a> and <a href=\"http://w3c.github.io/filesystem-api/#widl-Directory-enumerateDeep-Observable--File---DOMString-path\"><code>enumerateDeep</code></a> methods described in the FileSystem API draft.</p>\n<h2>When will this ship? Where should I send feedback?</h2>\n<p>When we ship will depend on the feedback that we get from users and other implementers; please <a href=\"https://nightly.mozilla.org/\">experiment with our implementation</a> and see how well the proposal works for you. Since the proposal is currently in the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/\">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a> feedback can either be sent to the <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wicg/\">WICG mailing list</a> or filed as an issue against the proposal in <a href=\"https://github.com/WICG/directory-upload/issues\">the Directory Upload proposal\'s github repository</a>. There\'s also a <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2015JulSep/0347.html\">thread on the public-webapps list</a> that you can respond to.</p>\n<p>If you\'re testing Mozilla\'s implementation, the main bugzilla bug tracking when we will ship this feature is <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1188880\">bug 1188880</a>. Either file bugs that block that one, or else comment in that bug.</p>\n</div>','1','https-jwatt-org-blog-2015-09-14-directory-picking-and-drag-and-drop','jwatt.org','1becc5b814780a61c091bc6e16dea84a','0','2015-09-21 09:41:18','2015-09-21 09:41:18');
